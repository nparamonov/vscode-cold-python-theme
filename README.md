# Cold Python Theme for VS Code

The goal of the Cold Python Theme is to reduce visual clutter and give you more space for your code and thoughts.

I hope this theme will be the one you enjoy working with day and night.

At the moment, full support for Python syntax is available, as well as a beta version of html, templates, css, shell, restructuredtext, json, js, batchfile, ini, yaml, toml, ts, dockerfile and some others.
